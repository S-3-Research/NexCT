const FAQ_LEFT = [
  { q: 'Who is eligible to apply?', a: 'Active U.S.-based licensed clinicians are welcome to apply — including RNs, NPs, PharmDs, MDs, and other healthcare professionals. Clinicians from all backgrounds — including bedside, community health, home health, infusion, oncology, ICU, med-surg, and public health — are encouraged to apply. No prior research experience is required.' },
  { q: 'Is this a job?', a: 'No. This is a sponsored training program that certifies you and makes you eligible for paid, project-based clinical research opportunities. You decide when and how often you participate based on your availability.' },
  { q: 'Are there paid opportunities?', a: 'Yes. Once certified, you become eligible for paid local research opportunities. Opportunities vary by geography, specialty, and study availability. You are matched to nearby opportunities — no searching required.' },
  { q: 'Can I be contacted for local or nearby opportunities?', a: 'Yes. Once you complete the program and earn your Research-Ready Clinician™ certificate, you can be matched directly to nearby research opportunities in your community.' },
  { q: 'Do I have to leave my current job?', a: 'No. The program is designed to fit around your existing clinical role. Training is virtual, self-paced, and asynchronous. Research opportunities are project-based and flexible.' },
]

const FAQ_RIGHT = [
  { q: 'Do I need prior research experience?', a: 'No prior research experience is required. Clinicians with or without research experience may apply. Selection is based on clinical background, readiness, geography, specialty, availability, and alignment with study needs.' },
  { q: 'Is the $3,000 tuition really covered?', a: 'Yes. For the first 30 selected clinicians, tuition is fully covered — a $3,000 value. There is no cost to apply or to complete the program if selected for a sponsored seat.' },
  { q: 'How are clinicians selected?', a: 'Selection is based on specialty, geography, availability, language skills, readiness, and alignment with current or future clinical research needs. Applications are reviewed on a rolling basis — early applicants receive priority consideration.' },
  { q: 'What if I don\u2019t get one of the sponsored seats?', a: 'You are still in the pipeline. Every clinician who applies is automatically considered for current and future funded cohorts \u2014 no need to reapply. As new cohorts open, qualified clinicians may be invited into fully funded scholarship spots.' },
  { q: 'How long does the training take?', a: 'Training is 8–10 hours total, delivered virtually and asynchronously. You complete it on your own schedule — no set class times, no live sessions required.' },
